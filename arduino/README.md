# Development
`arduino.ino` is the main sketch file. All c/cpp files within the `src` folder will be compiled and linked together upon compilation.

Install the [Arduino VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino) or the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload the sketch to the board.
